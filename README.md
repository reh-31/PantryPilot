# üç≥ PANTRYPILOT ‚Äì AI Recipe Generator  

ChefGPT (a.k.a. PantryPilot) is an **AI-powered recipe generation app** built with **Flask** and **Google Gemini API**.  
It allows users to input available ingredients and instantly get creative, step-by-step recipes generated by AI.  

The goal is to make cooking more accessible and creative by combining generative AI with a lightweight, user-friendly web application.

## üìñ Overview  
The system takes user-provided ingredients as input, constructs a structured AI prompt, and queries **Gemini AI** to generate:  
- Recipe title  
- Ingredients list  
- Step-by-step cooking instructions  

Unlike static recipe apps, **ChefGPT** can adapt to *any* combination of ingredients, even unusual ones, producing a brand-new recipe each time.  

The app runs on a **Flask backend** with a simple frontend, making it easy to use locally and adaptable for deployment.
